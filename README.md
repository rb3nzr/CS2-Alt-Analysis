A respository for experimenting with ways to analyze CS2 demo files for post game analysis.
**Currently a WIP, will update soon.**

To analyze a player's deaths from a demo file currently:
```
pip install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, colorama
```

```
pip install --pre awpy
```

```
python death_value.py -d demofile.dem -p playername --map
```
